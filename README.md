# Aladdin Chatbot
**Overview**
Aladdin Chatbot is designed to interact with users seamlessly using Dialogflow for natural language understanding. This chatbot can track orders, take new orders, remove items from the order, and complete the order process. The front end is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back end leverages FastAPI to handle API requests. Orders are stored in a MySQL database.
